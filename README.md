---

## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Git

### Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kingslayer458/HONEYX-HONEYPOT.git
cd HONEYX-HONEYPOT

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000                          # Port to run the server on
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_here    # Secret for session management
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com      # Admin email for login and alerts
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password_here  # Admin password for dashboard access
ADMIN_PHONE=+1234567890            # Admin phone for SMS alerts (optional)

# Email Configuration (for alerts)
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com     # SMTP username
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password        # SMTP password or app password

# Optional Services
# TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid      # For SMS alerts (optional)
# TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token     # For SMS alerts (optional)
# TWILIO_PHONE=+1234567890         # For SMS alerts (optional)

# Threat Intelligence
SHODAN_API_KEY=your_shodan_key     # For enriching attacker data (optional)
```

### Security Recommendations

- Use a strong, unique `SESSION_SECRET`
- Set a complex `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (min. 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Use app-specific passwords for email services
- Consider running behind a reverse proxy for production deployments

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
# Development mode
npm start

# With nodemon (auto-restart on changes)
npm run dev
```

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Log in with the admin credentials set in your `.env` file
3. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

### Deployment Considerations

- For production, consider using PM2 or similar process manager
- Set up proper firewall rules to allow incoming connections
- Consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx for SSL termination

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start with PM2
pm2 start index.js --name honeyx-honeypot
```

---

## üìä Dashboard

The Netflix-inspired dashboard provides a comprehensive view of honeypot activity:

### Main Features

- **Attack Timeline**: Chronological visualization of attack events
- **Attack Map**: Geographic representation of attack origins
- **Attack Types**: Pie chart showing distribution of attack methodologies
- **Top Attackers**: Bar chart of most persistent threat actors
- **Live Feed**: Real-time stream of recent attack events
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between viewing modes
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully functional on all device sizes

### Dashboard Controls

- **Refresh Button**: Manually update dashboard data
- **Time Range Selector**: Filter data by time period
- **Export Options**: Download logs in JSON or CSV format
- **Settings Panel**: Configure dashboard preferences

## ü™§ Fake Traps

HONEYX-HONEYPOT includes various fake resources to attract attackers:

### File Traps

- `/config` - Fake configuration files with seemingly sensitive information
- `/db` - Fake database dumps with synthetic data
- `/backup.zip` - Fake backup archive

### API Traps

- `/api/users` - Fake user data API
- `/api/system` - Fake system information API

### Web Traps

- `/admin` - Fake admin portal
- `/phpmyadmin` - Fake database administration tool

All interactions with these traps are logged with detailed information including:
- IP address
- User agent
- Timestamp
- Geographic location (if available)
- Request details

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### Protecting Your Deployment

- **Never expose admin credentials** in code or public repositories
- **Regularly rotate passwords** and API keys
- **Monitor logs** for unusual activity
- **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities

### Legal Considerations

- Ensure deployment complies with local laws regarding honeypots
- Consider adding a banner notification about monitoring
- Do not store personally identifiable information unnecessarily
